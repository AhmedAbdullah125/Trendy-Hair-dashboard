 * One place that turns whatever the API sends into something usable in `src`.
 *
 * The backend resolves every image field through `storageUrl()` (see
 * `app/Helper/system.php`), which returns an **absolute** URL — it passes
 * `http(s)://…` values through untouched and otherwise prefixes the public
 * disk URL. So the common case is "already a full URL, use it verbatim".
 *
 * This exists because the home screen used to re-prefix those absolute URLs
 * with `${API_BASE_URL}/v1/`, producing
 * `https://host/api/v1/https://host/storage/x.jpg`. Three different ad-hoc
 * cleaners then grew downstream to undo it — one of which (`BrandsRow`)
 * split on the bad prefix and so only worked *while* the bug was present.
 * Fixing the source without a shared resolver would have broken that screen,
 * hence a single function every caller shares.
 *
 * Kept tolerant on purpose: it still repairs a doubled prefix so any value
 * cached or persisted by an older build keeps rendering.
